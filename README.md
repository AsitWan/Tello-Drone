# Tello Drone Control Example

This repository contains a Python script designed to control a Tello drone using a specialized library. The code is structured in a way that is easy to understand for beginners and demonstrates how to interact with the drone through a series of commands.

The script starts by establishing a connection with the drone and retrieving its battery level, ensuring that the drone is ready for flight. Once connected, the drone is commanded to take off. After liftoff, the code uses deliberate pauses between actions to allow the drone to complete each maneuver safely. The maneuvers include a sequence of flips and directional movements, showcasing how to control the drone's orientation and movement using simple commands. Finally, the script brings the drone to a safe landing.

Key points covered in the code include:

- **Connection and Setup:** The drone is connected to by creating an instance of the control class and initiating communication. The battery percentage is checked to confirm that there is sufficient power for the flight.
  
- **Takeoff and Timing:** The drone is instructed to take off, and time delays are used between commands to ensure smooth operation and allow the drone to stabilize before performing subsequent maneuvers.
  
- **Maneuver Execution:** The code includes a series of commands to perform flips and send directional controls. These actions demonstrate how to use manual instructions to command the drone to move forward, backward, and perform flips in various directions.
  
- **Safe Landing:** Once the series of actions is completed, the code commands the drone to land safely, completing the flight sequence.

Before running the script, ensure that your Tello drone is fully charged and that your computer is connected to the drone's Wi-Fi network. This setup is essential for proper communication between the drone and the control script.

To use this code, simply run the Python file on your machine. The script will automatically connect to the drone, execute the commands in sequence, and display the battery level for your reference. It is recommended to perform these tests in an open area free from obstacles, ensuring safety during flight operations.

This README serves as a comprehensive explanation of the code's functionality, making it straightforward for beginners to understand how to control a Tello drone through manual commands. Simply copy and paste this content into your repository's README file on GitHub to get started.
